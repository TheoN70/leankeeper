# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

LeanKeeper is an AI agent specialized for Mathlib (Lean 4's community math library). The goal is to produce contributions that pass human review — not just proofs that compile, but code that respects Mathlib's conventions, typeclass hierarchy, naming, API patterns, and design standards.

The core metric is: **"does it pass Mathlib review?"**, not "does it compile?".

## Key Concepts

- **Lean 4**: proof assistant where compilation = correctness
- **Mathlib**: ~2M lines, ~210K theorems, organized as a DAG with a typeclass hierarchy (`Monoid → Group → Ring → Field`, etc.)
- **The problem**: AI companies dump massive compilable code that doesn't meet Mathlib quality standards (wrong generality level, missing API lemmas, broken naming conventions), poisoning the design space
- **LeanKeeper's role**: act as a "good junior Mathlib contributor" — explore the typeclass hierarchy, propose well-integrated definitions with standard API, follow naming conventions, and submit clean ~200-line PRs

## Development

### Setup

```bash
pip install -r leankeeper/requirements.txt
```

Dependencies: `sqlalchemy>=2.0`, `requests>=2.31`.

### Configuration

All credentials are loaded from environment variables (see `leankeeper/config.py`):
- `DATABASE_URL` — PostgreSQL connection string (required)
- `GITHUB_READ_ONLY_TOKEN` — GitHub personal access token
- `ZULIP_EMAIL` / `ZULIP_API_KEY` — Zulip account credentials

### CLI Commands

All commands run from the repo root via `python -m leankeeper`:

```bash
# Extraction
python -m leankeeper extract github          # PRs, reviews, issue comments (~1h10)
python -m leankeeper extract github-reviews  # Review comments inline only (~2h)
python -m leankeeper extract git             # Commits and stats (~1h)
python -m leankeeper extract zulip           # Zulip messages (~2-4h)
python -m leankeeper extract all             # All above (excludes patches and PR files)

# Heavy extractions (optional)
python -m leankeeper extract github-files    # Files modified per PR (~10h, ~20K REST requests)
python -m leankeeper extract git-patches     # Full diffs (10-50 GB)
python -m leankeeper extract git-patches --since 2024-01-01

# Database inspection
python -m leankeeper stats

# Export a table to JSONL
python -m leankeeper export <table> <output_path>
# Tables: commits, commit_files, pull_requests, pr_files, reviews, review_comments, issue_comments, zulip_channels, zulip_messages

# Migrations
python -m leankeeper.migrations.001_bigint_ids  # Integer → BigInteger for GitHub/Zulip IDs
```

## Architecture

The project is currently in **Phase 1 (Dataset)** — building extractors to collect training data from Mathlib's public sources.

### Package structure (`leankeeper/`)

- **`__main__.py`** — CLI entry point with three subcommands: `extract`, `stats`, `export`
- **`config.py`** — All configuration: paths, API URLs/tokens, rate limits, extraction params. Credentials loaded from environment variables.
- **`models/database.py`** — SQLAlchemy ORM models and `init_db()`. Uses `BigInteger` for external IDs (GitHub, Zulip) to handle IDs > 2^31. Defines all tables including future Lean-specific ones (declarations, imports, typeclasses) not yet populated.
- **`extractors/`** — One extractor class per data source, each taking a `session_factory` from `init_db()`:
  - **`github.py`** (`GitHubExtractor`) — GraphQL for PRs/reviews/issue comments in bulk, REST for inline review comments (with `diff_hunk`) and per-PR file patches. Handles rate limiting and network errors with automatic retry (3 attempts with backoff). Detects Bors-merged PRs via `[Merged by Bors]` title prefix.
  - **`git.py`** (`GitExtractor`) — Clones mathlib4 as bare repo, extracts commits via `git log` parsing, stats via `--numstat`, optional full patches via `-p`. Uses subprocess.
  - **`zulip.py`** (`ZulipExtractor`) — Extracts channels and messages via Zulip REST API with backward pagination from newest.
- **`migrations/`** — Database migration scripts (run individually as modules).

### Database

PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM. External IDs (GitHub, Zulip) use `BigInteger` (64-bit). Tables auto-created by `init_db()`. Full schema documentation in [`DB_ARCHITECTURE.md`](DB_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Data flow

All extractors follow the same pattern: `Extractor(session_factory)` → `extract_all()` → upsert into PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy sessions, committed in batches (`BATCH_SIZE=500`). Extractors are idempotent — re-running updates existing records (upsert).

### Training Data Sources

All public and extractible via GitHub and Zulip APIs:
- Mathlib Git repository (commits, diffs)
- GitHub PRs with review comments (~36K PRs, ~20K+ merged via Bors)
- Lean Zulip discussions on design decisions
- Mathlib4 GitHub wiki (19 pages, cloned in `mathlib4.wiki/`)
- Linter/CI results
- Import dependency graph

### Documentation

- **[Project wiki](https://github.com/TheoN70/leankeeper/wiki)** — Published as a separate GitHub wiki repo (`wiki/` directory). Covers quickstart, architecture, data sources, training pairs, Mathlib conventions, and roadmap.
- **[`DB_ARCHITECTURE.md`](DB_ARCHITECTURE.md)** — Full database schema documentation.

### Language

The project language is English. All code, comments, docstrings, log messages, and CLI output are in English.
